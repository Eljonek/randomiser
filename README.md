randomiser
==========

Generate a random result based on multiple arrays. I couldn't find one as simple as I needed so I just made one myself.

- Change the arrays in random.js to change your variables
- make sure to edit the joining words so it makes sense
- comment out variables if you don't need 3, or add more, whatever.
- multiple words will always split so only one word answers please.



This will be way better when I
---

- try and split arrays into seperate files so lots can be made easily and plugged together
- allow user to edit words and arrays from website
